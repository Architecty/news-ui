<h3>The Rules</h3>
<ul>
    <li>This board is about cleaning news. Keep the posts related to that. We all love cat pictures, but there are other sites for that.</li>

    <li>Don't be jerks. Don't insult others, don't be rude....basically, if a kindergarten teacher would get after their students for it, don't do it.</li>

    <li>No obnoxious advertising. If you're only here to sell, you're at the wrong place. Share interesting content and articles, not ads.</li>

</ul>
